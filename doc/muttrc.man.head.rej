+ These commands provide a way to handle compressed folders. The given
+ \fBregexp\fP specifies which folders are taken as compressed (e.g.
+ "\fI\\\\.gz$\fP"). The commands tell Mutt how to uncompress a folder
+ (\fBopen-hook\fP), compress a folder (\fBclose-hook\fP) or append a
+ compressed mail to a compressed folder (\fBappend-hook\fP). The
+ \fIcommand\fP string is the
+ .BR printf (3)
+ like format string, and it should accept two parameters: \fB%f\fP,
+ which is replaced with the (compressed) folder name, and \fB%t\fP
+ which is replaced with the name of the temporary folder to which to
+ write.
